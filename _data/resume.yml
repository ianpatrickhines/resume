# Personal Information
personal:
  name: "Ian Patrick Hines"
  title: "Strategic Architect & Political Infrastructure Builder"
  bio: |
    I build and scale political infrastructure that drives real results. Over the past decade, I've evolved from a solo operator to an architect of multi-layered systems that generate revenue, influence, and strategic advantage.

    My approach combines deep technical expertise with strategic thinking‚Äîidentifying opportunities, building the right teams, and creating sustainable competitive advantages. I've helped raise millions online, built data systems that power political operations, and created infrastructure that scales beyond individual campaigns.

    Today, I focus on strategic architecture: designing systems, building teams, and positioning organizations for long-term success in the political ecosystem.
