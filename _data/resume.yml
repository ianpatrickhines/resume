  bio: |
    If you‚Äôd told me years ago that I‚Äôd end up here, I probably would‚Äôve laughed (and then asked you for directions).

    Less than six months after my third kid was born, I got fired from an a16z-backed startup. So, naturally, I did what any reasonable person would do: I went to the Apple Store, bought a MacBook, and launched a website.

    That was over a decade ago. Since then, I‚Äôve somehow managed to build three businesses, send more than a billion emails (yes, really), and help raise millions of dollars online.

    I work hard‚Äîbecause, as it turns out, hard work actually works. Who knew?
