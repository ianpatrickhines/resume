### Analytics Tracking

The template includes optional DataBuddy analytics integration. **‚ö†Ô∏è Important for users who fork this repository:**

This template currently has DataBuddy analytics configured with the original author's client ID. If you fork this repository, you should:

1. **Get your own DataBuddy client ID** from [https://databuddy.cc](https://databuddy.cc)
2. **Replace the client ID** in `_data/resume.yml` with your own:

```yaml
settings:
  # ... other settings ...
  
  # DataBuddy Analytics Configuration
  # ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Replace with your own client ID if you fork this repo
  databuddy_client_id: "your_client_id_here"  # Replace with your actual client ID
  
  # Optional: Configure specific tracking features (all default to true)
  databuddy_track_outgoing_links: true
  databuddy_track_interactions: true
  databuddy_track_engagement: true
  databuddy_track_scroll_depth: true
  databuddy_track_exit_intent: true
  databuddy_track_bounce_rate: true
  databuddy_track_web_vitals: true
  databuddy_enable_batching: true
```

**To disable analytics entirely**: Comment out or remove the `databuddy_client_id` line.

**Why this matters**: If you don't change the client ID, analytics from your site will be sent to the original author's DataBuddy account instead of your own.

## Styling Customization

### Colors
Update theme colors in `_data/resume.yml`:

```yaml
settings:
  theme_color: "#0066cc"      # Light theme accent color
  dark_theme_color: "#5aa3ff" # Dark theme accent color (optional)
```

The resume includes comprehensive dark mode support:
- Theme toggle button (top-right corner) cycles between light/dark/auto modes
- System preference detection for seamless integration
- WCAG compliant contrast ratios for accessibility
- Smooth transitions with reduced-motion support

### Advanced Styling
For advanced styling changes, edit the CSS in `index.html`:

```css
/* Main colors */
color: #333;           /* Text color */
background-color: #fff; /* Background */
color: #0066cc;        /* Link color */
border: 1px solid #eee; /* Border color */
```

## Performance Features

- **Inline CSS**: Eliminates additional HTTP requests
- **System Fonts**: No web font loading delays
