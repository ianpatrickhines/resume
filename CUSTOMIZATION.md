# YAML Content Customization Guide

This file provides specific examples of how to customize your resume content using the `_data/resume.yml` file.

## Overview

All content is managed through `_data/resume.yml`. This approach:
- **Prevents HTML breaking**: Content is separate from structure
- **Easy to edit**: Simple YAML format, no HTML knowledge required
